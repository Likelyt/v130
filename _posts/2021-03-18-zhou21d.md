title: " Finite-Sample Regret Bound for Distributionally Robust Offline Tabular Reinforcement
  Learning "
abstract: " While reinforcement learning has witnessed tremendous success recently
  in a wide range of domains, robustness–or the lack thereof–remains an important
  issue that remains inadequately addressed. In this paper, we provide a distributionally
  robust formulation of offline learning policy in tabular RL that aims to learn a
  policy from historical data (collected by some other behavior policy) that is robust
  to the future environment arising as a perturbation of the training environment.
  We first develop a novel policy evaluation scheme that accurately estimates the
  robust value (i.e. how robust it is in a perturbed environment) of any given policy
  and establish its finite-sample estimation error. Building on this, we then develop
  a novel and minimax-optimal distributionally robust learning algorithm that achieves
  $O_P\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ regret, meaning that with high probability, the
  policy learned from using $n$ training data points will be $O\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$
  close to the optimal distributionally robust policy. Finally, our simulation results
  demonstrate the superiority of our distributionally robust approach compared to
  non-robust RL algorithms. "
