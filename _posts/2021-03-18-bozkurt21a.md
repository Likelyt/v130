title: " Rate-Regularization and Generalization in Variational Autoencoders "
abstract: " Variational autoencoders (VAEs) optimize an objective that comprises a
  reconstruction loss (the distortion) and a KL term (the rate). The rate is an upper
  bound on the mutual information, which is often interpreted as a regularizer that
  controls the degree of compression. We here examine whether inclusion of the rate
  term also improves generalization. We perform rate-distortion analyses in which
  we control the strength of the rate term, the network capacity, and the difficulty
  of the generalization problem. Lowering the strength of the rate term paradoxically
  improves generalization in most settings, and reducing the mutual information typically
  leads to underfitting. Moreover, we show that generalization performance continues
  to improve even after the mutual information saturates, indicating that the gap
  on the bound (i.e. the KL divergence relative to the inference marginal) affects
  generalization. This suggests that the standard spherical Gaussian prior is not
  an inductive bias that typically improves generalization, prompting further work
  to understand what choices of priors improve generalization in VAEs. "
