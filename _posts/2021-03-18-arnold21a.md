title: " When MAML Can Adapt Fast and How to Assist When It Cannot "
abstract: " Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants have achieved success
  in meta-learning tasks on many datasets and settings. Nonetheless, we have just
  started to understand and analyze how they are able to adapt fast to new tasks.
  In this work, we contribute by conducting a series of empirical and theoretical
  studies, and discover several interesting, previously unknown properties of the
  algorithm. First, we find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the
  tasks need only a shallow one. Secondly, linear layers can be added to the output
  layers of a shallower model to increase the depth without altering the modelling
  capacity, leading to improved performance in adaptation. Alternatively, an external
  and separate neural network meta-optimizer can also be used to transform the gradient
  updates of a smaller model so as to obtain improved performances in adaptation.
  Drawing from these evidences, we theorize that for a deep neural network to meta-learn
  well, the upper layers must transform the gradients of the bottom layers as if the
  upper layers were an external meta-optimizer, operating on a smaller network that
  is composed of the bottom layers. "
