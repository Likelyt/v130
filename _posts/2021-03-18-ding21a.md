title: " An Efficient Algorithm For Generalized Linear Bandit: Online Stochastic Gradient
  Descent and Thompson Sampling "
abstract: " We consider the contextual bandit problem, where a player sequentially
  makes decisions based on past observations to maximize the cumulative reward. Although
  many algorithms have been proposed for contextual bandit, most of them rely on finding
  the maximum likelihood estimator at each iteration, which requires $O(t)$ time at
  the $t$-th iteration and are memory inefficient. A natural way to resolve this problem
  is to apply online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) so that the per-step time and
  memory complexity can be reduced to constant with respect to $t$, but a contextual
  bandit policy based on online SGD updates that balances exploration and exploitation
  has remained elusive. In this work, we show that online SGD can be applied to the
  generalized linear bandit problem. The proposed SGD-TS algorithm, which uses a single-step
  SGD update to exploit past information and uses Thompson Sampling for exploration,
  achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret with the total time complexity that scales
  linearly in $T$ and $d$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds and $d$ is the
  number of features. Experimental results show that SGD-TS consistently outperforms
  existing algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. "
